# Two Pointers
```javascript
/*
WHEN TO USE: very helpful for sorted arrays & Linked Lists when finding a set of elements with a condition
NOTE: for UNSORTED inputs that expect NONCONTIGUOUS sets for outputs, helpful to sort and then use two pointers
variables to consider:
start position (usually start at 0) --> condition for iterating
end poition (usually start at .length-1)--> condition for iterating
condition: target

currentcondition > target: decrement end pointer (end--)
currentcondition < target: increment start pointer (start++)

# Fast and Slow Pointers
```javascript
/*
WHEN TO USE: when dealing with cyclic Linked Lists or array
MIDPOINT: since fast pointer is moving 2x as fast as slow pointer, when fast reaches the end slow will be at the middle
slow pointer will never catch fast pointer unless there is some kind of loop/cycle

# Reverse Linked List
```javascript
/*
variables to consider:
current: initally set to head, tracks what were currently reversing
previous: initally set to null, tracks the previous current
next: current.next
to reverse: set current.next to previous
reset:  set previous to current, set current to next

for reversing a sublist:
-Skip the first p-1 nodes, to reach the node at position p.
-Remember the node at position p-1 to be used later to connect with the reversed sub-list.
-Next, reverse the nodes from p to q using the same approach discussed in Reverse a LinkedList.
-Connect the p-1 and q+1 nodes to the reversed sub-list.

# Sliding Window
```javascript
/*
WHEN TO USE: CONTIGUOUS subset with a condition
variables to consider:
start position --> condition for iterating
end poition --> condition for iterating

-accumulator that doesnt need helper storage variable(ie. maxsum, max length seen so far, min length, count of something, etc )
-hashMap (if frequency of more than two types of items needs to be track, ie. number of chars seen, index, freq of char, etc. )
-accumulator that DOES need helper storage variable (ie. most seen char frequency, index of relevant char)

looking for max: extend (end++) when valid, and shorten (start++) when invalid
looking for min: shorten (start++ when valid), and extend (end++) when invalid
**length: end-start+1

    // repeating 'maxRepeatLetterCount' times and the remaining letters we should replace.

    // are not allowed to replace more than 'k' letters

# Merge Intervals

when finding the minimum or maximum depth

we use a QUEUE to keep track of the nodes of a level before we jump to the next level

note: space complexity of the algorithm will be O(W) where 'W' is the maximum number of nodes on any level

# Tree Depth First Search

use recursion (or stack for iterative approach) to keep track of all prevcious (parent) nodes while traversing

Approach:
1. start at root
2. if current node is NOT leaf:
 - process node (i.e. add value to total, add to sequence, substact from total, etc)
 - make recursice calls for each child
3. when leaf is found test if condition is met:
yes-> stop, no -> continue
